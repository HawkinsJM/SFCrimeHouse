# guided tour around creating an application using Flask-Bootstrap.
#
# To run this application yourself, please install its requirements first:
#
#   $ pip install -r sample_app/requirements.txt
#
# Then, you can actually run the application.
#
#   $ flask --app=sample_app dev
#
# Afterwards, point your browser to http://localhost:5000, then check out the
# source.
